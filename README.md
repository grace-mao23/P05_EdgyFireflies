## Description
The objective of this project is to create a Tinder-like web application for book lovers to communicate. The application will allow users to meet new people with similar genre/book interests and bring people together (at a reasonably safe distance). Users can swipe left/right on other users just like the Tinder app & message people in real-time, with the use of Web Sockets. Users can also browse through a variety of book selections with the help of the Google Books API.
